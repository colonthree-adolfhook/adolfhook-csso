# AdolfHook
A training software made for CSSO.

The entire thing is pasted (shoutouts icey for all of the code pretty much, lysm <3) and was made for personal use before I made it public.
Have fun with this thing.

# Usage
Inject adolfhook-1.7-final into hl2.exe using a DLL injector (no fucking shit)

# Compiling from source
Extract "adolfhook-1.7-source.rar" into a folder, open the solution with Visual Studio, preferably with the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed. Set the build configuration to Release | x86.
